# Serves as an abstraction to status widget in statusbar.
# If WM ever changes, an appropriate way to set status should be implemented here.
# For example, AwesomeWM uses awesome-client, dwmblocks uses signals to refresh.
# This script is called from various other places, ie. record script sets
# recording icon to signify that the screen is being recorded.
#
# USAGE: barstatus <set|clear> <text>
